msgid "What is Location-Aware Browsing?"
msgstr ""

#: firefox/geolocation.lang:26
msgid ""
"Websites that use location-aware browsing will ask where you are in order to "
"bring you more relevant information, or to save you time while searching. "
"Let’s say you’re looking for a pizza restaurant in your area. A website will "
"be able to ask you to share your location so that simply searching for "
"“pizza” will bring you the answers you need... no further information or "
"extra typing required."
msgstr ""

#: firefox/geolocation.lang:30
msgid ""
"Or, if you’re mapping out directions to get somewhere, the website will know "
"where you’re starting from so all you have to do is tell it where you want "
"to go."

#: firefox/geolocation.lang:34
msgid ""
"This service is totally optional &ndash; Firefox doesn’t share your location "
"without your permission &ndash; and is done with the utmost respect for your "
"privacy. And, like all elements of Firefox, it’s being created using open "
"standards to ease adoption by Web developers."

"If you consent, Firefox gathers information about nearby wireless access "

"get an estimate of your location. That location estimate is then shared with "
"the requesting website."
