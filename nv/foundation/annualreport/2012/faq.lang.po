"Our flagship product, the Firefox Web browser, is and will continue to be a "
"fundamental lever in driving the Web forward and advancing the Mozilla "

"Firefox OS is the first truly open operating system for mobile devices, "
"delivering the same security, privacy, customization and user control that "
"people have come to expect from the Firefox browser. Mozilla has built the "
"technologies and APIs to make the Web a rich and viable platform for the "
"mobile industry. With the support of valued partners from across the mobile "
"ecosystem, Firefox OS phones are now on sale in 10 markets globally (as of "
"mid-November 2013), and Mozilla will continue to advance its development and "
"adoption."

"Unlike our major competitors, Mozilla achieves success by helping more "
"people make choices about what software they want to use, what level of "
"participation they would like to have online, and how to take part in "
"building a better Internet. When we see growth in community contributors, "
"software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for example, we "
"know we are moving toward our goals."
